The goals of this project are to provide an improved focus on Developer Experience, maintenance, fast improvements and fast releases. Improvements over <code>react-email</code> include:</p><ul><li>Smoother Developer Experience (DX)</li><li>Better Command Line tools</li><li>Less complex, smoother Preview Server</li><li>Faster improvements and releases</li><li>Community-driven maintenance rather than company-planning priority</li><li>No vendor lock-in for tools. <code>jsx-email</code> uses only generic components and tools.</li></ul><p>We (the maintainers) use the JSX email daily. This fork was originally created as a canary channel for fixes from pull requests and issues that had been left unaddressed. JSX email grew faster, and the upstream team didn&#39;t give the project the love we felt it needed. When our help wasn&#39;t accepted, we felt a new direction was needed.</p></div>',5);function m(h,p,u,g,f,b){return n(),r(i,null,[l,c,d],64)}const _=a(s,[["render",m]]);export{v as __pageData,_ as default};
